*********************************************
Why can't I run a sim with UVM/OVM libraries?
*********************************************

Currently, only compiling with UVM/OVM libraries is supported on the public version of **EDA Playground**. We are working with
simulator vendors to offer limited public access for running simulations with these libraries.

The UVM/OVM libraries are available for private deployments of **EDA Playground**. We have several customers running
**EDA Playground** on their private cloud and using existing simulator licenses. We support all available simulators.

Private deployments are available FREE for academic and non-commercial research purposes.

*************************************************
What are the resource limits for running my code?
*************************************************

Each run is limited to 60 seconds runtime and 100MB of memory.

These limits can be increased for those who would like to be power users -- use EDA Playground on a regular basis and
provide feedback. Contact `Victor EDA <http://www.victoreda.com>`_ to request.

*********************************
Which web browsers are supported?
*********************************

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Internet Explorer 9 or higher

*************************************************************
How do I log in if I don't have a Google or Facebook account?
*************************************************************

We are working on providing additional ways to sign into **EDA Playground**. Meanwhile, please create a new Google
account at https://accounts.google.com/SignUp and use that to sign in.

Note: If you're using EDA Playground on a private network, log in with the authentication credentials for your network.

******************
Is VHDL supported?
******************

We're working on adding VHDL support to the public version of **EDA Playground**. VHDL support is currently
available for private deployments only.
