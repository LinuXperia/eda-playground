Account Validation and Logging In
*********************************

How do I validate my account?
=============================
ou can reach the `validation page <https://www.edaplayground.com/validate>`_ by clicking run whilst having selected either Synopsys VCS or Cadence Incisive from the **Tools & Simulators** menu or by visiting: `https://www.edaplayground.com/validate <https://www.edaplayground.com/validate>`_ directly. You will need to supply some additional indentification information, including a company, organisational or institutional email address. 

Enter your details in the form; read the terms and conditions carefully and, if you agree, click **I Agree**. An email will then be sent to the email address you entered. Open that email and click on the link it contains and your account will be validated.

I don't have a company or institutional email address. How can I validate my account?
=====================================================================================
Are you sure? Are you perhaps a member of a professional institution that gives you an email address? 

Are you sure you need to? Using Aldec Riviera Pro does not require account validation: this is a commercial simulator, which supports VHDL, Verilog, System-Verilog and UVM. Using Cadence Specman does not require account validation, either.

Which simulators require account validation?
============================================
* Synopsys VCS
* Cadence Incisive

What can I do without account validation?
=========================================
Pretty much everything. Using Aldec Riviera Pro does not require account validation: this is a commercial simulator, which supports VHDL, Verilog, System-Verilog and UVM. Using Cadence Specman does not require account validation, either.

I'm a Doulos customer; can I validate my account without access to a company or institutional email address?
============================================================================================================
I am looking into this.

I didn't receive your email, what can I do?
===========================================
Unfortunately, we put some code in to prevent multiple people validating using the same email address, which also prevents you resending to your email address. This will be fixed soon. So, just filling in the validation form again is not an option.

So, first check you spam folder to make sure our email is not stuck there. If not, check the email address you entered was correct (for example, people often seem to add '.com' instead of '.edu'; people often seem to be combining gmail addresses with work, for example people often seem to type something like 'myname1982@somerealcompany.com').

If all that fails, get in touch with me (Matthew) at getedaplayground@gmail.com. 

Why is account validation necessary?
====================================
Unfortunately, following some abuse of this privilige on EDA Playground, we have had to restrict access to some of the simulators. EDA Playground enables you to use some commercial, professional simulators, completely free of charge. In order to use some simulators, asking for some identification information and the agreement not to abuse this privilige doesn't seem much to ask.

How do I log in if I don't have a Google or Facebook account?
=============================================================
If you have an organisational/company/institutional email address then you can register from the  `login page <https://www.edaplayground.com/login>`_. Click on `Register for a full account <https://www.edaplayground.com/register>`_ or  `No Google or Facebook account? <https://www.edaplayground.com/register>`_.

Using EDA Playground
********************

How do I start a blank playground design?
=========================================
When working on code at https://www.edaplayground.com, you can start a blank design by clicking the EDA Playground logo in the top left.
(Before doing that, please ensure that your existing code edits are saved.)

How do I modify one of the examples? How do I modify someone else's playground?
===============================================================================
After making code edits, you can save your own version by clicking ==Copy==.

How Can I search for one of my Playgrounds?
===========================================
Click on your username (top-right) to go to the user pages; the "Playgrounds" tab will be selected. You can see your playgrounds listed and can change the listing order by clicking on one of the headings. 

You can also search for one of your playgrounds by entering search terms in the search box and clicking "Search your playgrounds". The search terms search the Name and Descriptions of each playground. You can narrow down your search by selecting the various menus underneath the search box.

Notice how selecting a menu adds search terms. You can type these in manually if you prefer. 

How can I publish one of my Playgrounds?
========================================
Select "Published (will appear in search results)" from the drop-down menu bottom-right of the share tab and then save your playground.

How Can I search for one of someone else's Playgrounds?
=======================================================
Click on your username (top-right) to go to the user pages; then select the "Community" tab. You can see your playgrounds listed and can change the listing order by clicking on one of the headings. 

You can also search for one of someone else's  playgrounds by entering search terms in the search box and clicking "Search all playgrounds". The search terms search the Name and Descriptions of each playground. You can narrow down your search by selecting the various menus underneath the search box.

Notice how selecting a menu adds search terms. You can type these in manually if you prefer. 

What if I accidently delete a playground? Can I get it back?
============================================================
Playgrounds are never actually deleted from the database. So, if you have linked to one of your playgrounds from some other page you don't need to worry about accidently deleting it - the URL will be preserved. (Deleting a playground simply removes it from your list.)

You can find your deleted playgrounds by adding the search term 'deleted:true' to the search box. Your deleted playgrounds will then be listed and you can undelete any one of them by clicking on the arrow to the right of each one.

What is EPWave?
===============
EPWave (EDA Playground Wave) is the first web browser-based wave viewer. It is part of EDA Playground.

Can I view the waves from my EDA Playground sim using EPWaves?
==============================================================
Yes, waves are supported for all languages, frameworks, and libraries. See :ref:`loading-waves-from-playground`

.. _social-media-label:

How do I get updates about new EDA Playground features?
=======================================================
New features are frequently being added to EDA Playground. Follow the updates on your favorite social media site:

* `@EDAPlayground on Twitter <httpss://twitter.com/edaplayground>`_
* `EDA Playground on Facebook <httpss://facebook.com/edaplayground>`_
* `EDA Playground on Google+ <httpss://plus.google.com/+Edaplayground_EPWave>`_

What are the resource limits for running my code?
=================================================
Each run is limited to 60 seconds runtime and 100MB of memory.

Which web browsers are supported?
=================================
To be honest, I wish I could say I support any browser. To me it goes against the fundamental brilliance of Sir Tim's marvellous invention, to then make a website that is only compatible with such-and-such a version of such-and-such a browser. Unfortunately, it's quite a complicated site and testing resources are limited. So, as far as I know these are supported:
 
* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari
* Internet Explorer 9 or higher

I'd certainly be interested in hearing about any browser-compatibility issues you come across. 

I have more questions. How do I get support?
============================================
==EDA Playground== is actively being improved. If you need help or have suggestions, support is available on
`EDA Playground forum <httpss://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eda-playground>`_

If you see a bug, however minor, please post on the forum or
file a new issue at httpss://github.com/edaplayground/eda-playground/issues (requires GitHub account)

For simulator support, please contact the appropriate simulator vendor.
